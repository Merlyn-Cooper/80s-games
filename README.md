This is a type of the BBCBASIC World War 1 game given in to the "Book of Games" 1985 by Adam Mastromarino

It's possible that this has been printed incorrectly in the magazine or typed up incorrectly afterwards by Merlyn-Cooper.
When the game is running an issue occurs on a line that is in a loop so without being able to debug it it's hard to know what is happening.

If someone can suggest a valid IDE that would be appreciated.
